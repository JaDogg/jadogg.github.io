I always wanted to build a usable programming language. So, this achieves that. I plan to use the language to build few personal projects that I need. Compiler is written in C++17 and will compile to C99 so that covers improving my understanding of C/C++.</div><div class="note"><p>1) Usable programming language 2) Use in personal projects 3) Ramp up in C/C++</div></div><div class="box"><div class="content"><p>I have always been interested in parsers, interpreters, and compilers. I have created toy-alike programming languages before, but I want to build something usable this time.</div><div class="note"></div></div><div class="box"><div class="content"><p>I want to make runtime library to be single include, so it makes compiling simpler. I have been playing around that idea <a href="https://github.com/JaDogg/potential-octo-invention">here</a>. C programmers shy away from using 3rd party libraries. However, I want to use excellent quality C libraries that I can easily embed. I am applying few patches on top of these libraries to ensure that they are consistently prefixed. This will allow me to expose them easily to end-user.</div><div class="note"></div></div><div class="box"><div class="content"><h3 id="i-want-to-contribute-to-c-open-source-projects">I want to contribute to C++ open-source projects</h3></div><div class="note"></div></div><div class="box"><div class="content"><p>It is easier to work on my own projects when I know the design and everything, but I don’t get exposure to new ideas or new concepts unless I find it myself.
