# Introduction
---
I got an idea to come up with set of reusable (technology oblivious) building blocks for system design. Main point is you can either use it diagrams.net (or desktop version), whiteboard or any other tool you like. I use it myself and there's no reason for people other than me to use it. I'm designing this backwards from system design diagrams, so I will come up with multiple system designs and extract common components. Any form of constructive criticism is appreciated as usual. 
;ðŸ¤” Disagreeing for the sake of it is bad, cargo-culting is bad, somewhere middle is probably zen. - Me.
