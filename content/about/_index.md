Hello there,

I'm Bhathiya Perera, but you can call me JaDogg – the developer behind thes [Yaksha Programming Language](https://yakshalang.github.io/). Fancy a chat about Yaksha? Join me on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SUsJu4PnwU) and let's geek out together!

My journey in the software world kicked off in December 2013, and since then, I've worked in startups, mid-sized wonders, and massive corporations. Computers have been my passion since 1999, and guess what? I taught myself programming between 2003-2005, armed with nothing but my wits (and no internet – can you believe it?). Since then, I've been on a coding spree! I have a passion for learning new things, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges. I also have a MSc in Advanced Software Engineering from the University of Westminster (UK).

Cheerio!
