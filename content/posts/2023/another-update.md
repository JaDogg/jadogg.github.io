I have decided to migrate my website from pure docbox to hugo. This year was not that great for me personally and I'm looking forward to more blogging and more fun in 2024.

I recently read [xnacly's post on language performance](https://xnacly.me/posts/2023/language-performance/) improvement, and I was interested in ~~stealing~~ copying his design for my blog in addition to wanting to perf test Yaksha and YakshaLisp.

# What will happen to docbox?

* Now docbox version in this repo supports exporting to markdown format. This is how I moved my content to this site.
* Docbox has builtin support for Yaksha syntax highlighting. So I may need to still use it for some posts. (at least for now)
* SDT (System design toolkit) page is gone for now. I will add it back when I have time.
