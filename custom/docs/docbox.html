#  DocBox Format
Rather simple file format to generate 2 sided content+note style documentation/web pages from a given template.

##  Different types of content that's allowed
* `RAW_HTML` - Any line that starts with `!!` read all lines until another `!!`, whole thing is raw HTML section
    * Alternatively line starting with `!!!` is a single line of raw html.
* `HEADER` - Any line that starts with a `#` is `h2`, `##` is `h3`, `###` is `h4`, and so forth until `h6`.
* `BULLET` - Any line that starts with `*` is a bullet point, `**` is a bullet point inside a bullet point
* `SEPARATOR` - if line contains `---` only (otherwise it's a normal line), this separate notes
* `NOTE` - if a line starts with `;` it is a note, which we will add to same cell on right side
* `NOTE_RAW_HTML` - if a line starts with `;!` same as note but in raw HTML
* `CODE` - lines between two triple backticks.
* `DEFAULT` - default lines.
* All lines without RAW HTML content are also treated as markdown.

I wanted a quick and dirty solution, so this does not show any errors for bad input.
If all content doesn't show up you probably made a mistake.

##  Output HTML file format
We basically just replace `$TITLE$` with title, `$DESCRIPTION$` with description.
Table of contents are generated from headers and should go to `$TOC$`.
Also, `$STYLES$` is replaced with pygments style.
Each section of the document is written as below.<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>+-----------+-------------+------------+
|           |             |            |
| Table     | Content     |  Note      |
| of        | Part 01     |  Part 01   |
| Contents  |             |            |
|           |             |            |
|           |             |            |
|           +-------------+------------+
|           |             |            |
|           | Content     |  Note      |
|           | Part 02     |  Part 02   |
|           |             |            |
|           |             |            |
+-----------+-------------+------------+
</pre></div>

##   Template files
Template directory should contain following
* `cell.html` - Format of a single content+note cell.
* `main0.html` - HTML before cells.
* `main1.html` - HTML after cells.

All content goes between `main0.html` and `main1.html`
